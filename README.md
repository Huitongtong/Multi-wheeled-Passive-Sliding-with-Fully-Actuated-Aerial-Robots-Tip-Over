# Multi-wheeled-Passive-Sliding-with-Fully-Actuated-Aerial-Robots-Tip-Over

This repo includes the experimental data outlining tip-over issues during passive sliding using a fully-actuated aerial vehicle available for analysis.

The experiments are associated with a paper under submission to Robotics and Automation Letter, titled "Multi-Wheeled Passive Sliding with Fully-Actuated Aerial Robots:Tip-Over Recovery and Avoidance".
